# Joana Socrates - End of Year Review 2025

**Manager:** Nick Stevenson

## Overall Performance

Overall your performance is "good" based on the goals we have set for this year.

January was a challenge due to on-going difficulties in finding an acceptable working partnership with your PM in A&F. You took some time off and returned to work able to take ownership of a new team - Foundations.

Since March your focus has been leading the Foundations team engineers, building relationships with the team and SASOL BPOs. In delivery terms, you have made some progress to improve incident response, and you are now deeply into the job of delivering ambitious Q4 business objectives.

You have taken steps to help teams with donated engineers for specific work happening outside of your scope of ownership (Productisation, Contract Structure). This kind of collaborative and flexible approach is a benefit to the company and is an example of how your approach to the job is a good fit for our values.

Per your mid-year review, I'd like you to be more proactive, specific and careful when you communicate your ideas and challenges. This is something we've agreed will improve and I hope to see that from Q4 onwards.

I think we can learn from the goal setting this time - future goals and self-assessments must be more detailed and demonstrate impact for the business. This is a responsibility that primarily falls to you when defining personal goals.

## Your Individual Goals

### Create or contribute to new joiner onboarding path in Foundations

Your rating for this goal is "good" but I have some concern about the achieved value of this goal and the minimal effort needed to achieve it.

I have been through your self-assessment for this goal and the onboarding and glossary links you shared. I accept that they are useful resources but they are minimal in their depth of detail. For that reason I can accept that this goal is done, but the work doesn't serve as a strong indicator of good performance this year in my opinion.

The Glossary is a page that has received a total of 7 (page) updates between April and June and simply defines 25 acronyms and 12 items of terminology. Since creation 6 unique viewers have viewed it a total of 26 times.

It is useful and its value will increase in future as new people join the team but it amounts to probably a couple of hours work at most. You've done it but I'm not sure how this shows real impact given only 6 unique viewers or high performance.

The new joiner "guide" - is more of a checklist which links to helpful resources that were already available, and which don't represent new work as part of this goal. As for the Glossary, the page will have increased value as new joiners start to use it. To date the page has seen 24 unique users and a total of 155 views. I found some of the linked content was unavailable to me. It would be worth doing a privs-check on the resources so everyone using the page can access them.

### [Additional Goal Information - Incident Statistics]

- 1.93 incidents per week
- 7 reopened incidents
- 54% response within SLA
- 71% resolved within SLA

In future cycles please limit your self-assessments to work which is primarily yours. This one includes examples where much of the work has been done by Akash and Gilda respectively:

- UK vehicle data provider (CAP) observations (Akash added most of the content)
- Germany vehicle data provider (DAT) observations (Gilda added most of the content)

## Ways of Working - Living Company Behaviours and Principles in Daily Work

Based on your work this year, and particularly with the Foundations team, I think you are aligning well with our Principles. Your experience as an EM means you know what to focus on with your team and you partner well with your BPOs and Felix.

Regarding the Behaviours I'd like to see improved alignment with **Empowering and Inspiring**. I would like you to pay more attention to high standards and building trust with me and SAS leadership. I can give two recent examples which are problematic and visible to me:

### Example 1 - Proactive problem solving

You have at several points this year raised legitimate risks associated with the Pricing Service and asked for more engineering headcount. I have repeatedly asked you to reduce the risk by sharing knowledge of the service between your many senior and experienced engineers. Recently (October) you again raised a request for more headcount, but you did it as an escalation to HR co-ing members of your team before you had taken real action to solve the problem yourself and without discussing with me first. I then needed to respond to your email (to the group) declining your request and asking for more specific information. This wasn't a confidence inspiring exchange.

This example indicates a lack of self-accountability (part of the **Empowering** behaviour), and a willingness to avoid problem solving for yourself, or with me your manager as a first point of reescalation.

I am glad to say that after we discussed it, you have taken steps to resolve the problem internally to the Foundations team.

### Example 2 - Need to improve the accuracy and specificity of your communication

I would like you to put extra effort toward improving this now because it is becoming a performance issue. I mention it here because communicating well is part of our SAS Ways of Working and I believe you are falling short of the high bar I expect from Engineering Managers. We have had several conversations about this and even discussed ways to use AI to help you improve.

As I have said before, you should ask yourself whether how you are communicating is helpful to your audience - is it specific? Does it provide enough context? Is it accurate and concise?

Your self-assessment for this review is a good example - there are many links that are broken, or don't have the right permissions or are simply poorly formatted. Such things ought to be mostly right-first-time if you are taking enough care. For example:

- No access to Raised VIN self service as a product feature
- Invalid url - Repository setup and lifetime requirements
- Broken links (all) under "Any Organization-wide Efforts" section are broken.

How should I interpret this other than by questioning your care toward important work, and your concern for successfully communicating? This is below expectation against our **Inspiring** company behaviour because you are not holding yourself to high standards, raising the bar in personal deliverables and interactions, or communicating clearly.

## SAS Ways of Working

## Our Shared Goals

### SAS 2025 Business delivery
**Final rating (for all SAS):** "good performance"

The ITLT determined that we have successfully delivered the equivalent of the anticipated feature set needed to meet the goal.

### Operational uptime and availability
**Final rating (for all SAS):** "underperformance"

The ITLT determined that because of the accumulated downtime from various longer-running incidents this year, SAS has not met the expected 99.995% availability threshold needed to qualify for "good" performance. We will need to take steps to identify lessons and corrective steps for better performance in 2026.
