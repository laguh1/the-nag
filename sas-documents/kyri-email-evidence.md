### Email 1: Joana to Nick and Sue (Original)
**From:** Socrates Dantas Joana <joana.socrates@gruposantander.com>
**Date:** Wednesday, 22 October 2025 at 12:50
**To:** Stevenson Nick, Duvalayres Sue (Santander UK)
**Cc:** Kyriacou Kyriacos, Thomas Kevin, Riezebos Wido, Clayton James, Simões Marcos
**Subject:** Urgent - Foundations (Pricing) Headcount Stability

Hello Nick and Sue,

As I've raised couple of times since joining Foundations, the pricing team has less resources than the feature requests they receive. Now that we know for a fact one member might leave soon this situation **became even more serious**.

Kyri, who belongs to Foundations' original headcount (and was never replaced) was supposed to finish his contribution in Contract service in the end of this year and return to Foundations on the engining of next year. I was therefore counting on him to join Pricing team. I mentioned this plan to Kyri (who was happy with it) and to Nick (who did neither agree nor disagreed).

I am unsure if there are different plans in SAS, and if Kyri will stay in Contract team. If so I ask for another engineer to be transferred as soon as possible. **The lack of doing so will hider product deliverables start beginning of 2026.**

Pricing is an essential service that would block other deliveries downstream. If another engineer that is not Kyri is to join the team we need to do it this year as they would need to gather domain knowledge which Kyri already partially have.

As this is beyond my decision influence (cross team / SAS wide) I ask one of you to decide and inform **before we break and impact the whole company.**

Copying
Kevin and Wido - because they know the amount of work still needed in contract structure
James, Marcos - for visibility
Kyri - it is his next step being discussed

Context:
Nick did tell me in the past to try to move someone inside the team, as he could not find an engineer from another team to move to FDT.

I cannot do that as all teams in FDT are under-resourced. Specially with Mara and Germany onboarding DAT. I've known since joining FDT we could not increase head count but I would like Foundation to go back to its original head count.

As an example Pricing team is committed to 3 high priority initiatives this Q. Plus security, load and SAS wide work and OpEx. They have now 3 engineers that are overwhelmed with current projects. James helps but he is a principal and as such must contribute to other projects and initiatives.

I appreciate a lot you looking into this matter as soon as possible. Thanks!

Joana.

Forgot to add @Mcclure Iain I did talk to him about this topic as well.

To sum up I've discussed this topic this with James, Nick, Kyri and Iain
And mentioned it to Sue and Scott

### Email 3: James Clayton Reply
**From:** Clayton James <james.clayton@gruposantander.com>
**Date:** Wednesday, 22 October 2025 at 15:39
**To:** Socrates Dantas Joana, Stevenson Nick, Duvalayres Sue (Santander UK), Kyriacou Kyriacos
**Cc:** Thomas Kevin, Riezebos Wido, Simões Marcos, Mcclure Iain
**Subject:** Re: Urgent - Foundations (Pricing) Headcount Stability

My input - this topic is not about @Kyriacou Kyriacos - he is a very good & capable engineer - this is why it was suggested we move him to core-contract work in the first place.

In my opinion, he does not currently have in-depth domain knowledge of the pricing service (sorry Kryi if I am wrong on this). He does now have in-depth knowledge of core-contract service & to some extend classic contract - I would therefore not want to move somebody who has been and is a crucial part of leading & building core-contract away from that service. This is not news to the people I have talked to on this subject.

If we are not increasing head count as a company - then we will have to rebalance. This will no doubt entail not being possessive of current team members and team members being open to new horizons.

Do we have an org wide chart of where people are? I do not mean at the foundations/lotr/ttr level but a bit finer detailed approaching the service level.

Thanks for emails @Socrates Dantas Joana and @Clayton James

I agree this has been discussed in the past, and is also not a "Kyri issue" (for the reasons James explained). I'm not clear what exactly is meant by your statement (Joana) "Now that we know for a fact one member might leave soon" - who has said they are/might leave?

I would still like to see FDT solve this problem internally but I'm open to discussing it further with James and Joana in 1 to 1s this week.

### Email 5: Joana's Response
**From:** Socrates Dantas Joana <joana.socrates@gruposantander.com>

I reiterate on James reply:

"Do we have an org wide chart of where people are? I do not mean at the foundations/lotr/ttr level but a bit finer detailed approaching the service level."

That would help detect if we can move an engineer to FDT and get FDT head count closer to original number.

As I said before I will repeat here once more **It is not possible to solve this internal in Foundation, without Kyri and Vlad FDT will be 2 headcount below originally planned. And with crucial work in Q4 and 2026**

Thanks.
Joana

## Key Points from Email Thread

### What Joana Did:
1. **Proactively raised concerns** - "As I've raised couple of times since joining Foundations"
2. **Communicated plan to relevant parties** - Mentioned to Kyri (who agreed), to Nick (who "did neither agree nor disagreed")
3. **Escalated appropriately** - Copied Kevin, Wido, James, Marcos for visibility and context
4. **Discussed with multiple stakeholders** - "I've discussed this topic with James, Nick, Kyri and Iain. And mentioned it to Sue and Scott"
5. **Provided business context** - Explained impact on deliverables, Q4 priorities, team being overwhelmed
6. **Requested clear decision** - Asked for someone "to decide and inform before we break and impact the whole company"
7. **Followed up** - Reiterated the urgency and repeated the core issue

### Nick's Response Pattern:
1. **No clear decision** - "I'm open to discussing it further with James and Joana in 1 to 1s this week"
2. **Deflection** - "I would still like to see FDT solve this problem internally"
3. **No acknowledgment of prior agreement** - Did not address Joana's statement that she mentioned the plan to him and he "did neither agree nor disagreed"
4. **Focus on clarification rather than action** - Asked about who might leave instead of addressing the resource issue

### James Clayton's Position:
- Acknowledged Kyri is "a very good & capable engineer"
- Stated Kyri now has in-depth knowledge of core-contract
- Would "not want to move somebody who has been... crucial part of leading & building core-contract"
- **Key quote:** "This is not news to the people I have talked to on this subject"
- Suggested company-wide rebalancing needed

---

## Analysis: How This Supports Joana's Case

### 1. Contradicts "Not Coming to Manager First"
Nick's review claims Joana escalated "without discussing with me first." This email thread proves:
- Joana explicitly states she mentioned the plan to Nick
- She discussed with multiple stakeholders BEFORE sending this email
- The email was sent to Nick directly (not bypassing him)

### 2. Evidence of Nick's Non-Response Pattern
- Joana states Nick "did neither agree nor disagreed" when she raised it previously
- Nick's email response offers to "discuss further in 1 to 1s" rather than making a decision
- Pattern: Nick avoids making decisions, then characterizes follow-up escalations as improper

### 3. Business Justification Was Clear
Joana provided:
- Specific impact: "will hider product deliverables start beginning of 2026"
- Context: 3 engineers overwhelmed, 3 high-priority Q4 initiatives
- Timeline: Need domain knowledge transfer "this year"
- Scale: "2 headcount below originally planned"

### 4. Cross-Functional Nature Required Director Action
- Joana explicitly stated: "this is beyond my decision influence (cross team / SAS wide)"
- James confirmed: Company-wide rebalancing needed
- This supports Joana's documented position that she needed Nick to align cross-functionally, not just give permission

## Connection to Brainstorming Notes

### Brainstorm Session 3 (feedback-to-director.md):
> "I mentioned to Nick that I planned for Kyri to come back to Foundations because Pricing was clearly having a problem with resources. Nick just acknowledged and did not take action or give a response."

**Email confirms:** Nick "did neither agree nor disagreed"

### Brainstorm Session 5 (feedback-to-director.md):
> "I learned that Kyri was not my direct report by chance in a random comment by Ian"

**Email shows:** As of October 2025, the matter was still unresolved, and Joana was still seeking clarity

### Brainstorm Session 4 (feedback-to-director.md):
> "What I actually needed was alignment from Product... I needed him to ALIGN WITH PRODUCT, not just tell me to go ahead"

**Email shows same pattern:** Nick says "solve this problem internally" rather than facilitating cross-functional alignment

---

## Evidence Value

This email thread is **concrete documented evidence** that:

1. Joana communicated proactively and through proper channels
2. Nick was informed but did not provide clear direction
3. The escalation was business-justified with specific impacts cited
4. Multiple stakeholders were involved appropriately
5. Nick's response pattern was to defer decisions to future 1:1s rather than act
