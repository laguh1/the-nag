## Input Handling Rules
- **DEFAULT**: All inputs → `feedback-to-director.md`
- **Exception**: Only when user explicitly says "self-assessment" → `self-assessment.md`
- **NO organization** of inputs until explicitly requested
- Just append raw inputs with timestamp

## Workflow Status
- [x] Collection phase (9 inputs collected)
- [x] Organization phase (feedback-organized.md created - FIRST DRAFT)
- [ ] Evidence gathering (in progress - see checklists in organized document)
- [ ] Final document refinement (pending)

## Next Actions
- Wait for user inputs with trigger phrases
- Append raw notes to appropriate document's "Raw Notes & Ideas" section
- **CONTINUE collecting chaotic brainstorm thoughts** - this builds context and provides more data for final document
- When user requests, update the organized document with new insights from additional brainstorms
- Encourage ongoing raw thought collection without self-editing

## Key Principle: Raw Collection is Valuable
**User instruction**: Keep adding chaotic, unstructured brainstorm sessions to feedback-to-director.md
- More raw thoughts = better context understanding
- Stream-of-consciousness captures emotions and connections
- Organizational structure comes later in feedback-organized.md
- No need to filter or organize thoughts before sharing them

## Session Log
- **2026-01-15 (continued)**: Incident metrics evidence collection - COMPLETED
  - Extracted data from 4 Power BI screenshots showing incident management metrics
  - Compared Sep-Dec 2024 (before Joana) vs Sep-Dec 2025 (under Joana)
  - **Key findings:**
    - Response SLA: 48.84% → 78.72% (+29.88 pp improvement)
    - Resolution SLA: 79.07% → 95.74% (+16.67 pp improvement)
    - SLA Breaches: 6 → 2 (67% reduction)
  - Created `incident-metrics-evidence.md` with full data comparison
  - Updated `response-to-review-2025.md` Section 5 with metrics evidence
  - This data directly contradicts Nick's criticism - all metrics improved significantly

- **2026-01-15 (continued)**: Kyri email evidence collection - COMPLETED
  - Extracted text from 4 WhatsApp images of email thread "Urgent - Foundations (Pricing) Headcount Stability"
  - Created `kyri-email-evidence.md` with full email thread (Oct 22-23, 2025)
  - Participants: Joana, Nick Stevenson, James Clayton, Sue Duvalayres, Kyri, Kevin, Wido, Marcos, Iain
  - Key evidence: Joana stated she discussed with Nick who "did neither agree nor disagreed"
  - Nick's response: Deferred to 1:1s, asked to "solve internally" despite cross-team nature
  - Updated `response-to-review-2025.md` Section 1 with email quotes as supporting evidence
  - This directly contradicts Nick's claim that Joana escalated "without discussing with me first"

- **2026-01-15**: Manager review extraction and analysis
  - Extracted text from 5 WhatsApp images of Nick's end-of-year review
  - Created `manager-review-2025.md` with full extracted text
  - Created `review-analysis.md` with detailed comparison against brainstorming notes
  - Identified 6 key patterns: reframing inaction as failure, criticism without timely feedback, context erasure, selective evidence, trust-destroying behaviors, denying accountability
  - Documented 8 major contradictions between review and documented evidence
  - Added evidence checklists and questions to raise

- **2026-01-09**: Initial setup completed
  - Created folder structure at `/Users/joanasocrates/Local Documents/claude/sas-documents`
  - Created self-assessment.md with BRAINSTORMING INPUTS section
  - Created feedback-to-director.md with BRAINSTORMING INPUTS section
  - Created INSTRUCTIONS.md for permanent reference
  - Created this CLAUDE.md status tracker
  - **07:21** - Added first input to feedback-to-director.md: Director's negative reaction to PM relationship issue (credibility concerns, sick leave mention, Trevor comparison)
  - **07:25** - Added second input: Communication criticism without specific examples, contradiction with direct reports' feedback, self-assessment review issues with broken links
  - **07:28** - Added third input: Selective use of incident statistics, ignoring improved response/resolution times, strategic approach to eliminate single point of failure not recognized
  - **07:30** - Added fourth input: Documents criticized without being read or opened
  - **07:32** - Added fifth input: Work prioritization strategy - avoided low-impact lengthy documentation and unproductive meetings to focus on urgent high-impact work
  - **07:35** - Added sixth input: Lack of recognition for contributions shared with larger audience (Datadog instructions, repo guidance, capacity plan template, tool documentation with video tutorials, EM guide collection, process improvement communications)
  - **07:37** - Added seventh input: Public and private criticism causing demotivation and offense, leading to withdrawal from sharing work to avoid attacks
  - **07:39** - Updated INSTRUCTIONS.md: Added guidance to fix typos and incomprehensible wording in raw inputs while preserving original meaning
  - **07:40** - Session PAUSED - User will continue later
  - **22:23** - Session RESUMED - Added eighth input from Google Drive document "Feedback to hijoputa": Goals set during transition couldn't be sustained full year, prioritized urgent work and team support over documentation; self-assessment done while writing 18 engineer assessments, viewed as formality since continuous 1-on-1s provided better insight; line manager suggested AI writing tools but didn't inform about Copilot for M365 access or help obtain permissions

- **2026-01-13**: Major brainstorming and organization session
  - **21:10** - Added ninth input (Brainstorm Session 2): Writing and documentation criticism with context of background as writer/PhD; personal goals unfair evaluation despite context changes; contrast with how I managed direct reports' goals; incident management criticism while showing contradictory improved data on screen; documentation criticism despite being top generator; public shaming incident; documents criticized without being opened; direct reports' feedback contradicting director's view; feeling of revenge motivation in year-end review
  - **21:25** - Created `feedback-organized.md` - comprehensive organized document structuring all 9 brainstorming inputs into 10 clear thematic areas with professional communication
  - Document includes: Performance Evaluation Issues, Communication Contradictions, Documentation Concerns, Incident Management Assessment, Goal Setting & Support, Recognition & Acknowledgment, Public vs Private Feedback, Leadership Philosophy Contrast, Credibility & Trust, Organizational Culture Concerns
  - Added evidence checklists and reflection questions for director
  - Updated status to "Collection + Organization Phase"
  - **21:35** - Updated INSTRUCTIONS.md and CLAUDE.md with guidance to continue adding chaotic brainstorm thoughts - this builds context and provides more data for final document; raw collection is valuable for capturing emotion, nuance, and connections
  - **21:40** - Added tenth input (Brainstorm Session 3): End-of-year review retaliation theory - specific examples of escalations used against me (Sue/Scott email about promotions, Kyri returning to Foundations email); detailed Kyri situation with failed attempts to get clarity from director; "floating collaboration and performance" criticism - disagrees due to lack of director support and nature of work in company (needs-based not hours-based); examples of proactive gap-filling (testing, documentation, product requirements, communication, Cloud technology initiative)
  - **21:45** - Added eleventh input (Brainstorm Session 4): PM problem in Finance team - director's lack of action and cross-functional alignment; needed tech-protected resources as systems collapsing, engineers burning out, incidents increasing; director said "go ahead" but that wasn't the escalation needed; needed him to ALIGN WITH PRODUCT, not just give permission; took long time and Scott's involvement to get meeting; in meeting with Rose, director never mentioned agreed percentage to her; user had to raise it proactively; Rose said Josh didn't agree because Nick clearly never told him; pattern of director avoiding his job of cross-functional stakeholder alignment
  - **21:50** - Added twelfth input (Brainstorm Session 5): Lack of communication, visibility, and clarification from director on company actions/decisions/alignments affecting EMs and engineers; example of EM goal for common ways of working never officially communicated, other EMs learned by chance; different EM loads - some have time for theory/workshops while others guaranteeing delivery; contradiction of wanting engineers to deliver faster while director focuses on useless meetings and extensive unread documents; director should give official communications and transparency on upper management directions; learned about restructure, team moves, and line management changes late or by chance (Kyri not being direct report); director's responsibility to keep EMs informed on cross-team/cross-area agreements; learns company decisions from engineers via gossip or Scott's IC meetings, not from director
  - **21:55** - Added thirteenth input (Brainstorm Session 6): POWERFUL CONTRAST - How user supports engineers vs how director treats user; keeps engineer limitations private in 1-on-1s, never public; engineers trust user with challenges (public speaking shame, writing anxiety, demo fear, focus issues, business domain struggles); works as confidant and mentor; believes people can't excel at everything; provides specific actionable support with examples; concrete support: helped with slide presentations by creating better examples, offered public speaking practice and feedback, organized focus improvement with 3-topic limit; trust and mentorship improve collaboration and output; contrasts with director's public shaming, demotivating, finger pointing; philosophy: impossible to be good at everything but with good manager can adapt and grow; this supportive growth-oriented approach is what user never found from director
  - **22:00** - Added fourteenth input (Brainstorm Session 7): Director does not stand by his actions/responses/communications; user's position: it's acceptable to fail but ethical professionals should own their mistakes; Example 1: Townhall where frontend was diminished - director later denied saying it despite it being in transcript and meeting recording; Example 2: Engineer reported director said not to do something a certain way, director wouldn't address privately (afraid of scrutiny), user raised it publicly in meeting, director denied saying it ("I never said that"); pattern of denying own words even when there's evidence (transcripts, recordings, engineer reports)
  - **22:05** - Added fifteenth input (Brainstorm Session 8): Gestapo-like environment in EM meetings - director allows gossip and blaming; EMs forwarding gossips and blaming others in meetings, finger pointing in front of director; user was about to give feedback to gossiping EM but surprised director did NOT correct this behavior or communicate it as undesired style; director's silence on gossip increases lack of trust and free speech between EMs; creates feeling that EMs/engineers/professionals cannot talk freely with each other; hinders free, cooperative, constructive communication between EMs
  - **22:10** - CONTEXT UPDATE: User clarified using voice-to-text (Google Docs) which causes misinterpretations; updated INSTRUCTIONS.md and CLAUDE.md with key people names and voice-to-text error correction guidance; fixed all instances of "Kitty" → "Kyri" throughout feedback file (Kyri is software engineer); documented key people: Nick (director/line manager), Scott (CTO), Sue (HR Director), Nic (Product Director), Kyri (engineer); added department structure: Finance (previous, with Accounting sub-team) → Foundations (current, with Pricing sub-team); To the Road department with Contract sub-team
  - **22:15** - CLARIFICATION: Kyri was loaned to Contract for 6 months with plan to return to Foundations as tech lead for Pricing, but Kyri NEVER came back and this was NEVER officially communicated; user learned Kyri was no longer direct report by chance from Ian's random comment; updated context to reflect this key example of director's communication failure
