# SAS Documents - Instructions

## Purpose
This folder contains performance review documents for Joana Socrates, Engineering Manager at Santander Consumer Finance.

## Document Structure

### 1. self-assessment.md
Contains self-assessment of performance at work. User will add inputs over time using the trigger phrase: **"self-assessment"**

### 2. feedback-to-director.md
Contains feedback and criticism for line manager. User will add inputs over time using the trigger phrase: **"feedback to director"**

### 3. CLAUDE.md
Status tracker that keeps record of progress, session log, and current phase of document creation.

## Workflow

### DEFAULT MODE: Feedback to Director
**IMPORTANT**: By default, ALL inputs when working in this folder go to `feedback-to-director.md` unless user explicitly says "self-assessment".

1. User will provide inputs and brainstorming ideas over time
2. **DEFAULT**: Any input → append to "BRAINSTORMING INPUTS - RAW COLLECTION" section in **feedback-to-director.md**
   - Fix typos and correct wording when it becomes incomprehensible
   - Preserve the raw thoughts and meaning - only make it readable
3. **ONLY** when user explicitly says **"self-assessment"** → append to self-assessment.md instead
4. **DO NOT organize, groom, or structure the inputs** - just collect them with timestamp
5. Update CLAUDE.md after each input to track progress
6. **ONLY** when user explicitly requests organization, create proper document structure from the raw inputs

### IMPORTANT: Keep Adding Chaotic Brainstorm Thoughts
**User guidance**: Continue adding chaotic, stream-of-consciousness brainstorm sessions to the raw collection file. This is BENEFICIAL because:
- **Builds context** - More thoughts = deeper understanding of patterns and issues
- **Provides more data** - Enriches the final organized document with specific examples and details
- **Captures emotion and nuance** - Raw thoughts preserve the impact and feeling that might be lost in organized writing
- **Reveals connections** - Stream-of-consciousness often connects ideas that wouldn't emerge in structured thinking

**Action**: Encourage user to keep dumping thoughts as they come, without self-editing or organizing. The organization happens later in the dedicated organized document.

### Voice-to-Text Input - Error Correction
**User uses voice-to-text tool** (Google Docs) which creates misinterpretations and errors. When processing inputs:
- Fix typos and correct wording when it becomes incomprehensible
- Use context to detect voice-to-text misinterpretations
- Preserve raw thoughts and meaning while making it readable

**Key Name Corrections:**
- "Kitty" → **"Kyri"** (software engineer, user's direct report)
- **Nick** = Director/Line Manager (user's boss)
- **Scott** = CTO
- **Sue** = HR Director
- **Nic** = Product Director (different person from Nick the director)

**Common voice-to-text errors to watch for:**
- Misheard names (like Kitty/Kyri)
- Homophone errors (to/too/two, their/there/they're)
- Missing spaces or merged words
- Incorrect capitalization
- Garbled technical terms

### Current Phase
- User will focus on **feedback to director** inputs for the next few days
- Switch to self-assessment only when explicitly mentioned

- **Team Size**: 18 engineers across 5 backend and frontend teams
