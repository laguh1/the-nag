## BRAINSTORMING INPUTS - RAW COLLECTION
*All inputs will be collected here as they come. NO organization or grooming until explicitly requested.*
*Use trigger phrase: "feedback to director" to add entries*

Director reacted negatively to the issue of relationship with PM. Some of the comments were "you are abandoning your team". Other were "you already went on sick leave to recover from burn out". Other comment was "it might work with Trevor as he is calm and collected" as an indirect suggestion I am not calm nor collected. Later he said it was good we changed EM because it showed there was a problem indeed with the PM which makes it clear that my feedback and collection of examples were not credible which implies I do not have credibility with my voice alone.

Other instance he said and insisted I do not communicate well saying it is becoming a performance issue. Failing to give specific examples and where and how exactly my communication has failed. Also the feedback from my direct reports is contrary to that stating I communicate clearly and objectively. At a later instance he mentioned I should think of who my audience is which is exactly what I replied when being criticised in a meeting with other EMs listening and witnessing the random rant. For the end of the year performance he solely mentioned my self assessment as an example of how bad I communicate citing many links were broken. He did not open to ask or investigate why the links were broken. Considering I sent my self assessment more than a month before the end of his assessment and during this time we had weekly meetings he had many opportunities to comment on the links and ask any doubt he had about the content and he failed to do so letting his last judgment for the last day before the official report to be published.

He used numbers and statistics on incident response to show that under the semester I was manager the number showed a decrease on support quality has decreased and lowering the tone saying it was a very little difference when in fact the number of incident had a slight increase which is expected as we had more features in the product this year but he did not mention the number he was showing himself that time to respond and solve was shortened and therefore improved. Therefore he was criticising my performance as a manager in incident management showing numbers that clearly showed an improvement in the period I was acting. My strategy was to instead of manage triage and respond to all incident to educate the engineers on rota how to do so first because that is their responsibility second because doing such I eliminate myself as a bottleneck and a single point of failure decreasing support quality when I would be on holidays, sick or busy.

---

### [2026-01-09 07:30]
Some of the documents he questioned or criticised were actually never read by him. Not even opened by him.

---

### [2026-01-09 07:32]
With all the high load of work is needed in SAS (company) I always prioritised urgent work and avoided work that would have little impact and would require long dedicated time as long documents or long useless talking in meetings without an actual actions or take aways. One example of something I avoided as much as I could was having to spend writing a document as this one.

---

### [2026-01-09 07:35]
At no point I got recognition or acknowledgement for work I done and shared with larger audience with the aim to improve and help their work. Example: instructions on how to solve datadog configuration for repositories, guidance for new and maintenance of repos to prevent company to go back to previous unmanaged state, capacity plan template that could be used by anyone easily and fastly, shared knowledge on how to use tools (well written objective document with video tutorial), collection of document to guide and orient new engineering managers, other people manager and align and share style and guidance. Contributions on participating and actively communicating how to improve our work and our product.

---

### [2026-01-09 07:37]
His comment in private and worse of all in a public forum (meeting or slack channel) continuously demotivated me, and actually offended me. At some point I decided to not share any of the work and initiatives I was doing to avoid criticism and attack.

### [2026-01-09 22:23]
**Regarding goals and quality of self-assessment:**

My goals were set during a transition period and could not be sustained during the entire year. I adapted my priorities, actions, and time to the most urgent and pressing matters to guarantee the quality of the product and features my teams were developing.

My focus was on getting to know the engineers on my new team, giving them support and attention, and helping them work in the best way possible to be more efficient and productive.

My self-assessment was done during a period when I had to write assessments and feedback for 18 engineers, which for me was more important than my own self-assessment. I myself told my engineers not to go overboard with their self-assessments because I saw what they were doing. I talked to them one-on-one, and the self-assessment for me was just a formality on paper. I knew through continuous talking and discussions with them how they were doing and what they were doing. I did not need the assessment document to tell me.

**Regarding AI writing assistance:**

My line manager told me to use AI to improve my writing but never mentioned there was Copilot for Microsoft 365. When he did mention it, I checked and I did not have access. I mentioned to him I could not see what he was saying and asked him to show me how he used it. He then said he didn't see it on the screen he had and just concluded I didn't have permissions. But he didn't tell me how to get the permissions or check to give me permissions.

### [2026-01-10 18:10]
**Resistance to documentation and instances of lying about actions:**

Director consistently resisted and questioned my initiative to document actions and decisions made about git repositories. When I proposed creating clear documentation of repository management decisions, configurations, and standards to prevent the company from returning to its previous unmanaged state, he pushed back rather than supporting this effort to improve team knowledge and consistency.

**Three specific instances where he lied or failed to deliver on commitments:**

1. **[Instance 1 - To be detailed]**: He claimed he did [specific action] but evidence/records show he did not actually do it.

2. **[Instance 2 - To be detailed]**: He promised to [specific action/support] and stated he had done so, but this was proven false when [specific outcome].

3. **[Instance 3 - To be detailed]**: He said he would [specific commitment] but failed to follow through, then later denied having made this commitment or changed his story about what was agreed.

*Note: Fill in specific details, dates, and evidence for each instance above.*

---

### [2026-01-10 18:15]
**Complained about things he himself failed to execute or check:**

Pattern of behavior where director criticizes or complains about issues, decisions, or quality problems that he himself was responsible for executing, checking, or approving but failed to do so.

**Specific instances:**

1. **[Example 1 - To be detailed]**: He complained about [specific issue/problem] but he was the one responsible for [checking/executing/approving] it and failed to do so.

2. **[Example 2 - To be detailed]**: He raised concerns about [specific matter] that I/team delivered, but he had [opportunity/responsibility] to review/check/provide input and did not do it.

3. **[Example 3 - To be detailed]**: He criticized [specific deliverable/outcome] but ignored his own responsibility to [specific action he should have taken] during the process.

*Note: Add specific dates, context, and evidence for each example.*

---

### [2026-01-10 18:20]
**Times he lied about saying or doing something:**

Instances where director either denied saying something he clearly said, or claimed he said/did something when there is evidence he did not.

**Specific instances:**

1. **[Instance 1 - To be detailed]**: He denied saying [specific statement/comment] during [meeting/conversation], but [evidence: witnesses/notes/recording/messages] prove he did say it.

2. **[Instance 2 - To be detailed]**: He claimed he [said/did/communicated] [specific action] but there is no evidence of this, and [contradicting evidence shows otherwise].

3. **[Instance 3 - To be detailed]**: He stated he never [said/agreed to/approved] [specific matter], but [documentation/email/message/witness] confirms he did.

4. **[Instance 4 - To be detailed]**: He insisted he [took specific action/sent communication/made decision] when this never happened, proven by [lack of evidence/contradicting records].

*Note: Gather specific dates, witnesses, messages, emails, or other evidence for each instance.*

---

### [2026-01-10 18:25]
**Data showing support quality and response time INCREASED (improved), not decreased:**

Director selectively presented incident statistics to criticize my performance, claiming support quality decreased during my time as manager. However, the actual data shows the opposite - support quality and response time improved.

**Key metrics that improved:**

1. **Response Time**: [Insert specific data - e.g., "Average time to respond decreased from X hours to Y hours, representing a Z% improvement"]

2. **Resolution Time**: [Insert specific data - e.g., "Average time to resolve incidents decreased from X hours to Y hours, representing a Z% improvement"]

3. **Support Quality Indicators**: [Insert specific metrics that improved - e.g., "MTTR, customer satisfaction scores, SLA compliance, etc."]

**What director did:**
- Showed increase in number of incidents (which was expected due to more features in product)
- Minimized/dismissed the improved response and resolution times
- Did not acknowledge that incidents increased due to product growth, not management quality
- Failed to recognize the strategic approach of training engineers to eliminate single point of failure

**Evidence to gather:**
- Screenshots/exports of incident metrics from the period before and during my management
- Dashboard data showing response times
- Resolution time statistics
- Comparison charts showing the improvement trends
- Any reports or presentations where these metrics were shared

*Note: Add specific numbers, dates, sources of data, and visual evidence (screenshots/charts).*

**Contrast: How director helps me fail vs. How I help engineers succeed**

A stark comparison between the director's actions that undermine my success and the deliberate, supportive actions I take to help my engineers achieve success.

**How the director actively helps me FAIL:**

1. **Withholds support**: [Example - e.g., "Suggests AI tools but doesn't provide access or help get permissions for Copilot"]

2. **Public criticism**: [Example - e.g., "Criticizes my communication in meetings with other EMs present, creating humiliation and loss of credibility"]

3. **Dismisses evidence**: [Example - e.g., "Ignores positive feedback from my direct reports, dismisses improved metrics, doesn't acknowledge contributions"]

4. **No recognition**: [Example - e.g., "Never acknowledges successful initiatives, documentation, or knowledge sharing that benefits the wider organization"]

5. **Sets unclear expectations**: [Example - e.g., "Criticizes without specific examples, says communication is a performance issue without defining what success looks like"]

6. **Creates obstacles**: [Example - e.g., "Resists documentation initiatives, questions efforts to improve processes"]

7. **Undermines credibility**: [Example - e.g., "Says my feedback about PM wasn't credible until another EM had same issue, bringing up sick leave as evidence of my weakness"]

8. **Provides feedback too late**: [Example - e.g., "Waits until performance review to mention broken links in self-assessment despite weekly meetings"]

**How I consciously help engineers SUCCEED:**

1. **Provide resources and remove blockers**: [Example - e.g., "Create clear documentation, templates, and tutorials with videos to enable engineers to work efficiently"]

2. **Give recognition publicly and privately**: [Example - e.g., "Acknowledge contributions in team meetings, celebrate successes, give credit where due"]

3. **Provide specific, actionable feedback**: [Example - e.g., "Give clear examples, explain what success looks like, offer guidance on how to improve"]

4. **Build credibility and trust**: [Example - e.g., "Listen to concerns, validate their expertise, trust their technical judgment"]

5. **Create psychological safety**: [Example - e.g., "Make it safe to ask questions, admit mistakes, raise concerns without fear of public criticism"]

6. **Invest time in 1-on-1s**: [Example - e.g., "Regular individual attention, understand their work and challenges through continuous conversation, not just annual reviews"]

7. **Shield from organizational chaos**: [Example - e.g., "Handle urgent issues, manage upwards, allow engineers to focus on their work"]

8. **Empower and delegate**: [Example - e.g., "Train engineers to handle incident triage independently, eliminating myself as bottleneck"]

9. **Set clear priorities**: [Example - e.g., "Help engineers understand what matters most, protect them from low-impact work"]

10. **Provide growth opportunities**: [Example - e.g., "Assign challenging work, encourage learning, support skill development"]

**The pattern:**
- Director's actions create an environment where failure is likely
- My actions create an environment where success is likely
- The feedback from my 18 direct reports confirms this positive approach works
- The contrast shows fundamentally different leadership philosophies

*Note: Fill in specific examples for each bullet point above with dates, context, and evidence.*

### [2026-01-10 18:35]
**Contrast: Accountability - How director denies failures vs. How I acknowledge and fix errors**

A comparison showing the director's pattern of denying responsibility and pretending failures didn't happen, versus my consistent pattern of acknowledging mistakes, taking ownership, and actively fixing problems.

**How the DIRECTOR denies and avoids accountability:**

1. **[Example 1 - To be detailed]**: When [specific failure/mistake happened], he denied responsibility by [saying/doing X], even though [evidence shows he was responsible].

2. **[Example 2 - To be detailed]**: He pretended he never [failed to do/said/approved X], despite [documentation/witnesses confirming otherwise].

3. **[Example 3 - To be detailed]**: When [problem occurred due to his action/inaction], he blamed [someone else/circumstances] instead of acknowledging his role.

4. **[Example 4 - To be detailed]**: He refused to admit [specific mistake], changing his story to say [alternative version], when the facts clearly show [what actually happened].

5. **[Example 5 - To be detailed]**: When confronted about [specific failure to deliver/execute], he [made excuses/denied it happened/claimed he did it] rather than taking ownership.

**Pattern of director's behavior:**
- Denies mistakes even when evidence exists
- Changes stories or claims he said/did something different
- Blames others or circumstances
- Never apologizes or takes ownership
- Deflects responsibility
- Pretends failures didn't happen

**How I ACKNOWLEDGE failures and FIX errors:**

1. **[Example 1 - To be detailed]**: When I [made specific mistake/error], I immediately acknowledged it by [specific action - e.g., informing team, apologizing], and fixed it by [specific corrective action taken].

2. **[Example 2 - To be detailed]**: I recognized that [specific approach/decision wasn't working], openly admitted [what went wrong], and changed course by [implementing new solution].

3. **[Example 3 - To be detailed]**: When [problem occurred that I was responsible for], I took ownership by [specific action], communicated transparently about [the issue], and resolved it by [specific fix].

4. **[Example 4 - To be detailed]**: After receiving feedback that [specific area needed improvement], I acknowledged the gap, sought to understand by [asking questions/gathering information], and improved by [specific actions taken].

5. **[Example 5 - To be detailed]**: When [error in my work/judgment was pointed out], I thanked the person for the feedback, corrected [the specific issue], and implemented [process/check to prevent recurrence].

**Pattern of my behavior:**
- Openly acknowledge when I make mistakes
- Take ownership without making excuses
- Apologize when appropriate
- Act quickly to fix problems
- Learn from errors to prevent recurrence
- Communicate transparently about issues
- Thank people for pointing out problems
- Model accountability for my team

**The contrast:**
- Director protects his ego at the cost of trust and improvement
- I prioritize growth, trust, and problem-solving over ego protection
- Director's denial prevents learning and improvement
- My acknowledgment enables continuous improvement and builds psychological safety
- Director's behavior models poor leadership to the organization
- My behavior models the accountability I expect from my engineers

### [2026-01-10 18:40]
**Creating a gestapo environment: Allowing EMs to gossip and complain instead of addressing issues properly**

Director fostered a toxic culture where engineering managers gossiped about and complained about each other behind their backs, rather than addressing issues directly and professionally. This created a surveillance-like, distrustful "gestapo" environment where people feared what others were saying about them.

**How director enabled and encouraged toxic gossip culture:**

1. **[Instance 1 - To be detailed]**: Instead of addressing [specific issue] directly with me, he allowed/encouraged [EM name or "other EMs"] to [complain/gossip about me], which I later learned about through [how I found out].

2. **[Instance 2 - To be detailed]**: During [meeting/conversation], he referenced what [other EM] said about me regarding [topic], using secondhand complaints rather than direct observation or my input.

3. **[Instance 3 - To be detailed]**: He shared with me gossip/complaints about [another EM/person], demonstrating that he spreads information behind people's backs rather than addressing issues directly.

4. **[Instance 4 - To be detailed]**: When [specific concern about me was raised], instead of coming to me first to understand or verify, he [discussed it with others/took it as fact/used it against me in review].

5. **[Instance 5 - To be detailed]**: He created or allowed an environment where [specific example of EMs talking behind each other's backs, forming alliances, or undermining each other].

**Impact of this toxic culture:**

- **Erosion of trust**: EMs cannot trust each other or the director
- **Fear and paranoia**: Never knowing what is being said about you behind your back
- **No psychological safety**: Cannot be vulnerable or admit challenges
- **Surveillance mentality**: Feeling watched and judged rather than supported
- **Division among EMs**: Pits managers against each other instead of building collaboration
- **No opportunity for defense**: Judged based on gossip without chance to provide context
- **Demotivation**: Discourages initiative knowing others might complain to director
- **Unprofessional environment**: Gossip culture undermines professional standards

**How this should have been handled:**

- Address issues directly with the person involved
- Verify information before acting on secondhand complaints
- Create an environment where EMs support each other
- Model professional behavior by not engaging in or spreading gossip
- Establish clear communication norms and expectations
- Deal with conflicts openly and constructively
- Build trust among the management team
- Protect people from behind-the-back criticism

**The pattern:**
- Director uses gossip and secondhand information as management tools
- Creates a culture of distrust and fear rather than collaboration
- Allows EMs to undermine each other rather than fostering teamwork
- Fails to model professional, direct communication
- Uses other people's complaints as weapons in reviews/feedback
- Never confronts gossipers about their unprofessional behavior

*Note: Fill in specific instances with dates, names (if appropriate), what was said, how you learned about it, and impact.*

### [2026-01-10 18:45]
**Contrast: Fear and self-consciousness vs. Safety and trust**

How the director's behavior made me feel self-conscious, scared, and unsafe, compared to how I deliberately create psychological safety and trust with my direct reports, helping them improve without fear.

**How the DIRECTOR made me feel SELF-CONSCIOUS and SCARED:**

1. **[Example 1 - To be detailed]**: When [specific situation], his [action/comment] made me feel [self-conscious/scared/unsafe] because [impact on my confidence/behavior].

2. **[Example 2 - To be detailed]**: His pattern of [specific behavior - e.g., public criticism] created fear that [what I was afraid would happen], leading me to [how I changed my behavior - e.g., stop sharing work].

3. **[Example 3 - To be detailed]**: After [specific incident], I became self-conscious about [specific aspect of my work] and started [protective behavior - e.g., second-guessing myself, avoiding risks].

4. **[Example 4 - To be detailed]**: The way he [handled situation/gave feedback] made me scared to [take initiative/share ideas/ask for help/admit challenges] because [feared consequence].

5. **[Example 5 - To be detailed]**: His [criticism/comment] about [topic] made me feel [specific emotion] and led to [change in my behavior - e.g., withdrawal, over-preparation, avoiding certain topics].

**Impact of director's behavior on me:**

- **Self-doubt**: Questioning my competence despite positive feedback from direct reports and successful outcomes
- **Fear of speaking up**: Avoiding sharing ideas or concerns to prevent criticism
- **Withdrawal**: Stopped sharing work and initiatives to avoid attacks
- **Hypervigilance**: Constantly worried about what might be criticized next
- **Defensive behavior**: Over-preparing, over-documenting to defend myself
- **Loss of confidence**: Second-guessing decisions I would normally make confidently
- **Stress and anxiety**: Mental health impact from constant criticism and lack of support
- **Isolation**: Feeling alone and unsupported in the role

**How I create SAFETY and TRUST with my direct reports:**

1. **[Example 1 - To be detailed]**: When [engineer name/role] struggled with [specific area], I [created safe space by - e.g., private 1-on-1, normalized the challenge], helped them improve by [specific support provided], and they [outcome - improved, gained confidence].

2. **[Example 2 - To be detailed]**: [Engineer] identified they wanted to improve in [area], so I [accommodated by - e.g., provided resources, adjusted responsibilities, paired with mentor], resulting in [positive outcome].

3. **[Example 3 - To be detailed]**: I detected that [engineer] could improve in [area], approached it by [how I raised it - gently, with specific examples, privately], and together we [created improvement plan/provided support], leading to [successful improvement].

4. **[Example 4 - To be detailed]**: When [engineer] made a mistake with [situation], instead of criticizing, I [how I handled it - used as learning opportunity, focused on fixing not blaming], which helped them [learn and grow without fear].

5. **[Example 5 - To be detailed]**: [Engineer] felt safe enough to tell me [challenge/weakness/concern], and I responded by [supportive action taken], demonstrating that vulnerability is safe in our relationship.

**How I create psychological safety:**

- **Private feedback**: Give constructive feedback in 1-on-1s, never public criticism
- **Normalize challenges**: Make it clear that struggles are normal part of growth
- **Collaborative improvement**: Work together on development, not impose from above
- **Celebrate vulnerability**: Thank people for being honest about challenges
- **Focus on growth**: Frame feedback as development opportunity, not performance issue
- **Provide resources**: Give tools, training, support needed to improve
- **Patient approach**: Allow time for improvement, check in regularly
- **Recognize progress**: Acknowledge improvements and effort, not just outcomes
- **Model vulnerability**: Share my own challenges and learning journey
- **Trust by default**: Believe in their capabilities and good intentions

**Impact of my approach on direct reports:**

- **Confidence**: Engineers feel capable and supported in taking on challenges
- **Openness**: Feel safe admitting when they don't know something or need help
- **Growth mindset**: See challenges as opportunities rather than threats
- **Initiative**: More willing to try new things, take calculated risks
- **Collaboration**: Ask for help and support each other
- **Honesty**: Transparent about progress, blockers, and concerns
- **Loyalty and trust**: Positive feedback from direct reports confirms the relationship
- **Better performance**: Psychological safety enables better work and innovation

**The contrast:**

- Director's fear-based approach diminishes performance and wellbeing
- My trust-based approach enhances performance and wellbeing
- Director creates self-consciousness; I create self-confidence
- Director makes me scared to act; I make engineers brave to try
- Director isolates; I connect and support
- Director breaks down; I build up

*Note: Fill in specific examples for each numbered item with dates, names (where appropriate), situations, actions taken, and outcomes.*

### [2026-01-13 21:10] - Brainstorm Session 2

**Writing and documentation criticism - context and background:**

Writing is something I appreciate and it can be meditative since you have to focus time to write well and put your thoughts into writing. I've been doing that since I was a teenager. As a teenager I wanted to be a writer - I have many short stories and drafts of novels. During my PhD the main output was to write articles, and so I did. Knowing that was the main outcome of this work, I dedicated my time to writing and editing.

As a manager having to oversee five different teams, four to five different features at the same time, filling the gaps of other professionals as product managers and TPMs, I didn't see focusing my time on writing as a main urgent priority. Also I did not have separated, dedicated focus time of many hours for writing. I still believe that being aware, following channels, and addressing engineers' needs was the main priority for me. I didn't want to waste the focus and dedicated time to do something that I didn't see as an urgent matter for the company or the project that would bring gains, especially given the economical budget situation at the moment.

**Personal goals criticism - unfair evaluation:**

I don't find it fair that the two personal goals I set should be taken so seriously as to consider my end-of-year performance based on the achievement of those goals. One of them I had to change when I changed teams, and I thought I had to change the goal to something generic. One of them was to create a new joiner plan - when I was still in Accounting and moving to Foundations we were still hiring people and the aim was to grow in size with many open vacancies. We were actively recruiting, interviewing managers, TPMs, PMs and engineers. So it made sense back then to invest time on creating a new joiner training and path. I still chose this as a goal to fulfill the need for the whole 12 months.

During this time I did not have feedback from my line manager. Because of common sense, I did the minimum for Foundations and I dropped it when I saw we were not hiring anymore and I had other urgent matters. It just seemed completely a waste of my resource and capacity to be investing on new joiner content when we were not hiring as many new joiners anymore.

**How I managed my direct reports' goals differently:**

To give an example of a different, more supportive attitude towards direct reports: I started being their line manager after they had to set the goals, and I had to accompany those goals from both teams. When they gave me their goals, I didn't have context, but still I gave feedback, helped adapt and rewrite the goals into something that without the full context of Foundations would seem more feasible and more clear on how to achieve the goals - which is something I did not have from my line manager during the year.

I followed up, especially on mid-year review. I followed up on how they were achieving their goals and I openly told them to not take their goals so seriously and to decrease the scope to adapt to the need of developing features. I openly told them that it was impossible to achieve their ambitious theoretical goals with the amount of urgent matters that were first priority on the team. Many engineers on my team had their goals adapted in writing and in agreement between me and them, so it was something achievable and something that made sense to the company.

In this company we always have changing priorities - different changes in priorities. We all have new features that are pressured by business. Setting goals 9 months ahead and making them top priority and dropping out any other work to achieve those goals, I think it's absolutely irresponsible for a professional in this company. In this company we need to be adaptable to the new technologies and the changing needs. You have to be dropping and following up different contexts and different priorities as they come.

**Incident management criticism with contradictory data shown on screen:**

One of the feedbacks I got for my end-of-year review was saying that my approach of not controlling and overseeing incidents had actually decreased the incident management on my team. I did proactively document and explain to the engineers how to act on incidents in order to improve the incident management and not to create a bottleneck economy. This was a conscious, rationalized, and well-thought attitude following up my experience in the Finance team.

In Finance I managed most incidents, and modesto for a time as well, so the engineers were laid back and the escalation time to respond and communication with end users was too much dependent on one single person. When I was busy doing performance reviews, training new joiners, on holidays or sick, the response for incidents decreased.

When I moved to Foundations, I knew it would take time for me to learn the context and the domain in order to be controlling and monopolizing the incident solution. As a result, I stopped being a bottleneck and problem-solving and communication with end users was done as it's supposed to be done in a rota. The whole aim of having a rota is exactly to distribute responsibility and increase attention for the end customer and recovery for incidents. Having one person overseeing and being the sole responsible creates one single point of disruption.

**What shocks me the most:** My line manager was criticizing my approach and saying that the incident management results decreased, while showing in a document on a screen the SLAs to respond and SLAs to resolve actually showing INCREASED performance - which shows in numbers that the performance in those items was actually INCREASED. He was showing me those numbers while saying that my strategy of distributing problem-solving throughout the rota decreased the performance. So it seems to me that the idea was only to criticize and find a problem to criticize my management strategy, while the numbers on the document and on the screen were showing exactly the opposite.

The only number that increased was the number of incidents, which is expected - in 12 months difference we had much more users and therefore much more incidents. But what matters is that even though the number of incidents increased, the time to respond and the time to solve DECREASED (improved) with my strategy.

Even though my strategy was to document and train engineers to follow the protocol of incident management - replying, explaining, and engaging with end users, knowing the time to respond and the actions of incident management (changing status, triaging, and assigning the ticket to themselves or contacting the responsible team), all of that took time for me to educate the engineers who did not know how to do that. But it increased our response time and resolution time as well as the communication and accountability of the incidents.

Even though I trained and documented for engineers proactively and insistently, I kept overseeing, engaging and responding to incidents as I learned the domain. It's not as if I left the incidents - that can be seen in many incidents where I was the one changing status and responding and engaging with end users.

**Documentation criticism despite being top document generator:**

It revolts me the fact that my line manager consistently insists on my "problem" with documentation, but the one or two examples he uses to illustrate that don't show where I'm failing. He doesn't give concrete examples of how I should improve my documentation skills. Apparently that's not a requirement for other professionals. Looking at numbers of documentation generation for the engineering managers (not the senior or principal engineers), I am among the top document generators.

**Public shaming incident in meeting:**

Once when he was publicly shaming me for my capacity of documenting in a meeting with other engineering managers - I mentioned this was in the first semester of 2025 - I mentioned that I write having my audience in mind. Knowing that engineers and other managers are overloaded with work, I try my best to write objective, straightforward documents with bullet points and minimum details in a separate section. I also add images, videos, and yellow bold visual messages for people who are overloaded with messages to jump to the main takeaways. That is an example of how I design these documents.

**Documents criticized were never opened by him:**

Even though he comments continuously that I have a problem with documentation and that it's a performance issue, most of the documents I created that he criticized were just ignored - he didn't even open or read the documents, as shown by the history in Confluence viewer stats.

**Direct reports' feedback contradicts his view:**

I proactively asked for feedback from my direct reports in the middle of the year, which was something that he did not include in my performance review for mid-year (as I did for my own direct reports). After I asked proactively, one of the things that came from the AI summary is that according to my direct reports, I communicate directly, clearly, and objectively. He made the comment after realizing that this was completely contrary to his own perception and prejudice. He mentioned in the output that "it's different from his view" - implying I should take his view instead of the actual feedback from the people I work with daily.

**Feeling of revenge motivation:**

I have the feeling that his end-of-year review was motivated by a desire for revenge. I escalated situations that he failed to give me answers, action, or reply to. When I escalated and involved [others], he seemed upset that I went around him.

**End-of-year review feels like retaliation for escalations:**

The impression I have reading my end-of-year report is that it's a report of situations my line manager did not appreciate - instances where I escalated because he failed to provide answers or take action.

**Example 1: Email to Sue and Scott about promotion situation for Kyri and Steven**

I brought my concern about the promotion situation for Kyri and Steven to Nick in meetings. He did not give me an official answer or take official action. Therefore, I acted by escalating this to Sue and Scott. This appears to have been used against me in my year-end review.

**Example 2: Email about Kyri coming back to Foundations**

I sent an email regarding Kyri coming back to Foundations. I included all the people I was conversing with about this: Kyri himself, James, Widow, Kevin, and Ian.

**Background on Kyri's situation:**
- My agreement with Kevin and the Contract people was that Kyri would be linked to Contract for 6 months
- I put this in writing: the passing arrangements, the expectations, the timeline, and how it would be useful not only for the company and Contracting but for Kyri's development himself
- I cannot decide outside my team how an engineer is distributed
- I had a given headcount for Foundations, and loaning an engineer decreases the official headcount
- I don't mind if the need is on a different team, but I'd like to be communicated if a plan or agreement is not being taken forward

**Attempts to get clarity - all failed:**
- I mentioned to Nick that I planned for Kyri to come back to Foundations because Pricing was clearly having a problem with resources
- Nick just acknowledged and did not take action or give a response
- I mentioned this to James - he clearly said he did not agree
- I mentioned it to Scott - Scott said he didn't know about my plan
- I told Scott I had mentioned it to Nick, but Nick did not say yes or no, and my feeling was that he agreed
- As time went by, I never had an answer if Kyri was coming back or not

**Impact of no answer:**
- I did not know what to do with the Pricing situation
- I knew that delivery of features that were already being problematic would be even worse and at risk with the decreased resources
- Since I cannot decide where resources are distributed to teams, I needed alignment on the passing arrangement

**Attempted to get decision from others:**
- When discussing with Widow or Ian, they didn't have an answer or opinion and said it was not up to them to decide
- When I discussed with Kyri, Kyri liked the idea of coming back to Foundations and being the tech lead on Pricing
- Kyri started acting as such, and I was preparing the team with that in mind

**I needed a yes or no answer so I could plan:**
- After absence of official response from the director, I sent an email
- The director took this email as a personal offense and attack
- I believe it's quite unfair to use this as evidence in my end-of-year review - using one email as representative of 12 months of behavior and performance output

**Feedback about "floating collaboration and performance":**

Another feedback I got from my line manager in the end-of-year review was about my "floating collaboration and performance throughout the year."

I do not agree for two reasons:

**Reason 1: Lack of support and trust from line manager**
Due to my lack of support and trust in my line manager, I decided to continue cooperating and acting as I saw the need in the company without sharing with him or in common meetings with him. I started sharing on channels or just acting on what was needed.

**Reason 2: Nature of work in this company**
I don't believe that in this company a continuous, same-state performance and action makes any sense. I act as need comes, when it's needed. That's what I was told when I was recruited and continuously in this company: we work not on hours but on the needs and requests of the company.

- When there was a need, I worked extra hours and weekends
- When things were calmer, I was doing maintenance work instead of urgent, extreme extra hours work
- I always jumped into different knowledge and different areas as I saw there was a gap and a need
- I did that fast and proactively to have an urgent and continuous output as possible

**Examples of proactive gap-filling:**
- The lack of testing in Foundations
- The lack of understanding of documentation in Foundations
- The lack of product requirements
- The lack of communication between teams

**Cloud technology initiative:**
When the new technology Cloud came and I saw there was opportunity for the whole company and my manager colleagues, I dedicated extra time to studying and acting so I could:
- Create tools
- Learn how to use it in a way I could share with my colleagues
- Help everybody be more productive
- Help our product and our company grow faster with higher quality

### [2026-01-13 21:45] - Brainstorm Session 4

**PM problem in Finance team - director's lack of action and alignment:**

Another example where I felt the lack of action and leadership from my line manager was with the problem of the PM in the Finance team.

**The core issue:**
I raised the need to have a minimum amount of tech-protected resources so that the systems would not collapse. I raised this in email and in meetings with him. I insisted on what was the response and how should I act.

**Director's inadequate response:**
Eventually I got from him: "Just go ahead and keep the resources."

I kept the resources and protected time for the technical work.

**But that wasn't the real problem:**
What I actually needed was alignment from Product. The product manager was giving new features and initiatives to engineers while the systems were collapsing. This was:
- Collapsing engineer resources
- Creating burnouts
- Increasing the number of incidents

**What I needed vs what I could do:**
- The decision to keep resources protected was NOT the escalation I needed
- I can make that decision by myself
- What I needed him to do was ALIGN WITH PRODUCT
- I needed him to validate my position with Product, not just tell me to go ahead

**How long it took:**
It took a long time and many instances of me insisting for him to finally create a meeting between me and Product.

**Required Scott's involvement:**
It needed Scott's involvement to finally have an alignment that there should be an agreement on a percentage of protected technical work.

**Director failed to communicate agreement:**
Even in the meeting with Rose, Nick (director), and me, at the end of the meeting Nick never mentioned the percentage agreement to Rose.

**I had to raise it myself:**
I proactively asked Rose about the protected percentage. Rose said Josh did not agree with that.

**The problem:**
It was clearly never mentioned to Josh by Nick. If it wasn't for me raising this topic in that moment, it would have stayed as is - no alignment, no agreement, no protection for technical work.

**Pattern:**
Director gave me permission to do something within my control, but failed to do his actual job - which was cross-functional alignment with Product stakeholders. I had to push repeatedly for him to set up the meeting, and even when he did, he failed to communicate the agreed-upon approach to the relevant people (Rose, Josh).

### [2026-01-13 21:50] - Brainstorm Session 5

**Lack of communication, visibility, and clarification from line manager:**

I miss from my line manager communication, visibility, and clarification on actions, decisions, and alignments that are done in the company that impact engineers and engineering managers.

**Example: EM goal for common ways of working**

For instance, one engineering manager had a goal of defining common team and engineering manager ways of working. That's a good idea and a good attitude from that engineering manager. But:

- It was never officially communicated
- It was never brainstormed if maybe that was something to be done collectively by all engineering managers
- Other engineering managers learned about this action and work by chance, or by the engineering manager talking about it by themselves
- It was never checked if that was a high priority
- It was never checked if that was urgent
- It was never checked if other engineering managers were aligned
- It was never checked if there was time for the workshops, documentation, and dedicated meetings to discuss proposals, theories, and final documents

**The problem with different EM loads and priorities:**

My feeling is that the load and clearly critical deliveries in teams were different. While one or another engineering manager had time to dedicate to writing theory, making meetings, or creating workshops, other engineering managers were guaranteeing delivery, learning systems, and filling gaps in their own teams to guarantee the product was at the minimum standard required by business and upper management.

**Lack of consideration for different team needs:**

The lack of consideration for teams' different needs and urgency on what is the company's most important and most impactful work was clear and quite revolting.

**The contradiction:**

On one hand, we want to decrease low performance and push engineers to make them deliver faster and create value to the product. On the other hand, some managers and the director are focusing on useless meetings, useless conversations, useless hours of brainstorming, and creating extensive documents that are not fully or properly read by anyone due to lack of time.

**Other examples of director's responsibility that's lacking:**

Other examples of what I think should be the responsibility of the director:
- Giving official company communications
- Giving clarifications and transparency on the directions and protocols set by upper management and communicated directly to engineers

**Specific examples of learning things late or by chance:**

1. **The restructure**: Only at a later time was it commented on by the director
2. **Team and engineer restructures and moves**: Not communicated proactively
3. **Line management changes**: I learned that Kyri was not my direct report by chance in a random comment by Ian

**Director's main responsibility:**

I feel that one of the main responsibilities of the director is to keep engineering managers on top of what's being agreed in the company:
- Cross-teams agreements
- Agreements between different areas (operations, platform, product, etc.)

And that's something I feel the director is lacking.

**How I actually learn about company decisions:**

I learn many communications and decisions from engineers. The engineers learned about them either:
- From conversations or gossip between themselves
- From IC meetings with Scott

I should be learning this information from my director, not through the grapevine or from my own engineers.

### [2026-01-13 21:55] - Brainstorm Session 6

**Contrast: My supportive approach vs director's blame/shame/intimidation approach**

An example of a different attitude instead of blame, shaming, or intimidating the professional is what I do, and I believe is the goal of a people manager.

**How I handle engineer limitations - with trust and privacy:**

When I detect or discuss a limitation with an engineer, I keep it in a trust-based, private communication meeting - verbal, one-on-one. I don't mention that in public meetings with other engineers. I don't use that in official documentation without proper mentorship and help from my side.

**Examples of engineers who trusted me with their challenges:**

Some examples are engineers that trusted me with the fact that:
- They don't like or are ashamed of public speaking inside the company
- They don't like to write documents
- They don't like to make technical demos
- They have problems focusing on just one problem
- They don't like and have problems learning the business domain
- They don't like or have problems contributing to technical work
- They have difficulties working on less than one issue at the same time

**My philosophy on limitations:**

For all of those limitations, which I truly believe did not jeopardize their contribution, work, and dedication to the company, I worked as a confidant and mentor. I increased the trust they can have in me by telling them that people have different capabilities and they would never excel in all the different profiles.

I told them that we could work together to enhance and increase their skills in the areas where they have deficits.

**How I provide specific, actionable support:**

I gave specific examples where they could improve. I gave specific examples of different alternate behaviors, trainings, and people they could use as examples and talk to in order to enhance their areas.

**Concrete examples of support I provided:**

1. **Slide presentations**: I helped an engineer create a slide presentation by giving them a centralized example of why their slides for the presentation were not ideal. I did myself examples of a better version of the slides, which they improved to make a great final presentation.

2. **Public speaking**: For the ones that feel nervous speaking in public, I offered myself for them to train with me. I gave feedback and tips for them to feel more relaxed and engage with the public.

3. **Focus and multitasking**: For the ones that have lack of focus when working on many tasks at the same moment, I organized with them to try to work on just three topics at best. I went through with them what topics they are working on and followed up on how they feel about having a more focused behavior.

**The result:**

I believe with this trust and mentorship behavior, we improve engineers' collaboration and output in the company, and we grow together.

**The contrast with director's approach:**

This is different from public shaming, demotivating, and finger pointing on what a professional is lacking or working on in a subpar way, instead of extending a hand and helping and listening.

**My belief:**

It's impossible to be good at everything all the time. But if you have a good, supportive line manager, you can always be adapting, changing, and trying to have a different attitude.

That's what I always do and how I behave with my direct reports to make them excel in their performance and output.

**What I never found from my line manager:**

This supportive, growth-oriented approach is something I never found from my direct line manager.

**Director does not stand by his actions, responses, and communications**

I do not appreciate the fact that my line manager does not stand by his actions, his responses, and his communications.

**My position on failure:**

As I said, it's feasible for any professional and human being to fail in their decisions and communications. But a good professional and an ethical professional should stand by what they failed to do and what they miscommunicated.

**Director fails to own his mistakes:**

Some examples of where the director failed to own and stand by his miscommunications:

**Example 1: Townhall where frontend was diminished**

After questioning, he later said he never said this. This is despite the fact that it was in the transcript and meeting recording.

When I asked for clarity, he denied saying it even though there was documented evidence.

**Example 2: Engineer contacted me about director's guidance**

An engineer contacted me saying that the director mentioned in a meeting or in a communication that he did not want something to be done in a certain way.

**Director wouldn't communicate directly:**

The director did not address this privately with me. I guess he was afraid of being put under scrutiny.

**I raised it publicly in the meeting:**

I mentioned publicly in a meeting about deciding how to proceed that the director did not align with or suggested to not act like that.

**Director denied it:**

The director said, "I never said that."

**Pattern of denying his own words:**

Even when there is evidence (transcripts, recordings) or when engineers report what he said, the director denies his own communications and decisions rather than owning them or explaining the context.

### [2026-01-13 22:05] - Brainstorm Session 8

**Gestapo-like environment in engineering manager meetings - director allows gossip and blaming**

I also did not appreciate in a couple of engineering manager meetings where one or another engineering manager was forwarding gossips and blaming.

**My view on this behavior:**

I think that's not an attitude to create - a gestapo-like environment where engineering managers cannot talk between themselves or talk to engineers without being exposed to finger pointing, to the point of being mentioned to an engineering manager in front of the director in a meeting.

**I was going to give feedback, but director surprised me:**

I was about to give this feedback to the engineering manager who was doing the gossiping and blaming. But it surprised me that during these meetings where this gossip gestapo "he said, she said" attitude was happening, this was not communicated by the director as undesired communication style.

The director did not correct this behavior or say it was not the desired communication style.

**Impact of director's silence:**

I think this increased the lack of trust and free speech between engineering managers. It creates the feeling that we engineers, professionals, ourselves cannot talk freely between each other.

**Result:**

This hinders the free, cooperative, constructive communication between us engineering managers.
