# Analysis: Manager's Review vs. Documented Evidence

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Purpose:** Compare Nick Stevenson's end-of-year review with documented context and evidence from brainstorming sessions

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies significant contradictions between the official performance review and the documented context. Key patterns include:

1. Nick reframing his own inaction as Joana's failure
2. Criticism delivered without timely feedback despite weekly meetings
3. Goal evaluation ignoring organizational context changes
4. Selective dismissal of positive evidence (direct report feedback, documentation output, improved metrics)
5. Trust-building requested while engaging in trust-destroying behaviors

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. The Escalation Issue (Example 1 - Pricing Service Headcount)

**What Nick wrote:**
> "Recently (October) you again raised a request for more headcount, but you did it as an escalation to HR co-ing members of your team before you had taken real action to solve the problem yourself and without discussing with me first."

**Documented context (Brainstorm Session 4):**
- Joana raised the need for tech-protected resources repeatedly in emails and meetings
- Nick's response was "Just go ahead and keep the resources" - which wasn't the help needed
- What was actually needed: Nick to **align with Product**, not just give permission
- It took a long time and Scott's involvement to finally get a meeting with Product
- Even in the meeting with Rose, Nick never mentioned the agreed percentage
- Joana had to proactively raise it; Rose said Josh didn't agree because Nick clearly never told him
- **Pattern:** Nick avoided his job of cross-functional stakeholder alignment

**Contradiction:**
Nick frames this as Joana not coming to him first, but documentation shows she raised it multiple times and he failed to take action. She escalated because he wasn't doing his job of aligning with stakeholders. The escalation was a result of his inaction, not a bypass of proper channels.

**Evidence to gather:**
- [ ] Emails showing the timeline of requests to Nick
- [ ] Documentation of meetings where this was raised
- [ ] The email to HR with context showing prior attempts

### 2. Communication Criticism (Example 2 - Broken Links)

**What Nick wrote:**
> "Your self-assessment for this review is a good example - there are many links that are broken... Such things ought to be mostly right-first-time if you are taking enough care."

**Documented context:**
- Self-assessment submitted **more than one month before** Nick's assessment deadline
- They had **weekly meetings** during this period - multiple opportunities to mention broken links or ask questions
- Nick waited until **the last day** before official report publication to raise this issue
- He did not open links to investigate why they were broken or ask for clarification
- No indication he attempted to click the links until writing his review

**Contradiction:**
Nick had weeks to raise this concern and chose not to. Using broken links as evidence of a "performance issue" when he could have asked about them at any weekly meeting is problematic. This supports the documented pattern that he criticizes without giving timely feedback that would allow course correction.

**Questions for Nick:**
- Why wasn't this raised in any of the weekly meetings between submission and review?
- Did you attempt to access the links before the final day?
- If this is a "performance issue," why wasn't it flagged when there was time to fix it?

**Evidence to gather:**
- [ ] Timeline: Date self-assessment was submitted vs date feedback given
- [ ] Calendar showing weekly meetings that occurred in between

### 3. Goal Evaluation - New Joiner Onboarding

**What Nick wrote:**
> "I have some concern about the achieved value of this goal and the minimal effort needed to achieve it... the work doesn't serve as a strong indicator of good performance."

**Documented context:**
- Goal was set during transition from Accounting to Foundations when Foundations was **actively hiring** (managers, TPMs, PMs, engineers)
- Hiring **ceased mid-year**, making this goal obsolete
- Joana received **no feedback throughout the year** to adjust or redirect the goal
- She adapted using common sense when she saw hiring had stopped
- Deprioritized new joiner content to focus on more urgent matters

**Contrast - How Joana manages her direct reports' goals:**
- Inherited engineers who had already set goals before she became their manager
- Provided feedback to help adapt goals despite lacking full context
- Made goals more feasible and clear on how to achieve them
- At mid-year review, openly told engineers to adjust scope to adapt to urgent feature development needs
- Collaboratively adapted goals in writing to be achievable and meaningful

**Contradiction:**
Nick criticizes the goal achievement without acknowledging that organizational context changed significantly. He provided no ongoing feedback throughout the year, unlike how Joana actively manages her own direct reports' goals. Setting goals 9 months ahead and evaluating rigidly without adaptation is irresponsible in a company with constantly changing priorities.

**Evidence to gather:**
- [ ] Documentation of when hiring stopped in Foundations
- [ ] Records showing no feedback was given on this goal during the year

### 4. Documentation Criticism Pattern

**What Nick wrote:**
> Criticizes the Glossary as "probably a couple of hours work at most" with "only 6 unique viewers"

**Documented context:**
- Joana is **among the top document generators** among Engineering Managers (excluding senior/principal engineers)
- Documents Nick criticized were **never opened by him** (Confluence viewer history shows this)
- He consistently labels documentation a "performance issue" despite her high output
- He doesn't give concrete examples of how to improve documentation skills
- This standard apparently not applied equally to other professionals

**Contradiction:**
Nick diminishes documentation work while simultaneously claiming Joana has documentation problems. The Glossary criticism (few viewers) ignores that hiring stopped - fewer new joiners means fewer viewers. This is circular logic: goal becomes less relevant due to context change, then criticized for low impact caused by that same context change.

**Additional context:**
- Joana has a background as a writer (short stories, novel drafts since teenage years)
- PhD training where main output was writing articles successfully
- As EM overseeing 5 teams simultaneously and filling gaps for PMs/TPMs, dedicated focus time for lengthy documents wasn't available
- Writing approach is audience-aware: objective, straightforward, bullet points, images, videos, bold visual messages for quick scanning

**Evidence to gather:**
- [ ] Confluence viewer stats showing Nick didn't open criticized documents
- [ ] Comparison of documentation output among EMs

### 5. Incident Management - Hidden Good News

**What Nick wrote:**
> Lists statistics: "54% response within SLA, 71% resolved within SLA"
> "1.93 incidents per week, 7 reopened incidents"

**Documented context (Brainstorm Session 2):**
- During the review, Nick showed data where **SLA to respond IMPROVED** (decreased/faster) and **SLA to resolve IMPROVED** (decreased/faster)
- He was "criticizing my performance while simultaneously showing data on screen that proved performance IMPROVED"
- The number of incidents increased (expected - more users, more features after 12 months)
- The metrics that matter (response time, resolution time) improved

**Strategic approach documented:**
- In Finance team, Joana managed most incidents, creating single point of failure
- When she was busy/sick/on holiday, incident response quality decreased
- Foundations strategy: Train engineers on rota instead of monopolizing incident management
- Goal: Eliminate herself as bottleneck and single point of failure
- Proactively documented incident management protocols
- Trained engineers on responding, engaging with users, triaging, assigning tickets
- Result: Improved service metrics while building sustainable, distributed capability

**Contradiction:**
The review presents incident statistics without context of whether they improved. Joana's documentation shows they did improve, and the approach was strategic and successful. Nick appears to have selectively presented data to criticize while the actual trend was positive.

**Evidence to gather:**
- [ ] Incident response/resolution time data (before vs during Joana's management)
- [ ] Screenshots/exports of the metrics Nick showed on screen during review

### 6. The "Lack of Self-Accountability" Framing

**What Nick wrote:**
> "This example indicates a lack of self-accountability (part of the Empowering behaviour), and a willingness to avoid problem solving for yourself"

**Documented context:**
- Joana escalated because Nick **failed to provide answers or action**
- She needed cross-functional alignment that only he could provide
- The Kyri situation: She never received official communication that Kyri was no longer her direct report - learned by chance from Ian's random comment
- Pattern: Nick avoids his responsibilities and then frames escalations as failure

**Additional examples of Nick's avoidance:**
- PM problem in Finance: Said "go ahead" but didn't align with Product (his job)
- Kyri returning to Foundations: No answer given despite multiple attempts
- Promotion situation for Kyri and Steven: No official answer or action
- AI tools suggestion: Mentioned Copilot but didn't help Joana get access

**Contradiction:**
Nick reframes his failure to act as Joana's "lack of self-accountability." The documentation shows multiple instances of her trying to get answers from him and being ignored or given inadequate responses. The escalations happened because he wasn't doing his job.

### 7. The Trust Issue

**What Nick wrote:**
> "I would like you to pay more attention to high standards and building trust with me and SAS leadership"

**Documented trust-destroying behaviors by Nick:**
- Publicly shamed Joana for documentation capacity in meeting with other EMs (first semester 2025)
- Allows "gestapo-like" gossip environment in EM meetings
- EMs forward gossip and blame others; Nick does not correct this behavior
- Denies his own statements even when recorded (Townhall transcript, engineer reports)
- Brought up sick leave for burnout inappropriately in performance context
- Compared Joana unfavorably to Trevor ("he is calm and collected")
- Dismissed positive feedback from 18 direct reports as "different from his view"

**Contrast with Joana's approach:**
- Keeps engineer limitations private in 1-on-1s, never public
- Engineers trust her with challenges (public speaking shame, writing anxiety, demo fear, focus issues)
- Works as confidant and mentor
- Provides specific actionable support with examples
- Philosophy: People can't excel at everything, but with good manager support they can adapt and grow

**Observation:**
Nick asks Joana to build trust while engaging in behaviors that systematically destroy trust. His approach (public criticism, allowing gossip, denying his words) creates fear and self-consciousness, not trust.

### 8. What the Review Does NOT Mention

**Absent from Nick's review - things documented in brainstorming:**

1. **Positive feedback from 18 direct reports** about communication ("directly, clearly, objectively")

2. **Contributions to wider organization:**
   - Datadog configuration instructions
   - Repository guidance and management documentation
   - Capacity plan template (reusable by anyone)
   - Tool documentation with video tutorials
   - EM guide collection for new engineering managers
   - Process improvement communications

3. **Strategic elimination of single point of failure** in incident management (framed negatively instead)

4. **Context changes** that made goals obsolete (hiring freeze)

5. **His failure to communicate organizational changes** (Kyri no longer being direct report)

6. **His failure to support** with AI tools (mentioned Copilot but didn't help get access)

7. **Improved incident metrics** (response and resolution times)

8. **The pattern of escalations resulting from his inaction**, not from bypassing proper channels

## Summary: Key Contradictions

| Nick's Claim | Documented Evidence |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "You didn't come to me first about Pricing" | Raised multiple times; Nick said "go ahead" but didn't align with Product (his job) |
| "Broken links show poor communication" | Submitted 1+ month early; weekly meetings to ask; Nick waited until last day |
| "Goal achievement was minimal effort" | Context changed (hiring stopped); no feedback given to adapt |
| "Communication is a performance issue" | Direct reports say she communicates "directly, clearly, objectively" |
| "You lack self-accountability" | Escalated because Nick failed to act on repeated requests |
| "Build trust with me" | Nick publicly shames, allows gossip culture, denies his own recorded words |
| "Documentation is a problem" | Among top document generators; documents criticized without being opened |
| Incident statistics presented | Data on screen during review showed IMPROVED response/resolution times |

---

## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Reframing His Inaction as Her Failure
When Joana escalates because Nick doesn't act, he frames it as her "not coming to him first" or "lacking self-accountability."

### Pattern 2: Criticism Without Timely Feedback
Issues raised at year-end that could have been addressed in weekly meetings throughout the year.

### Pattern 3: Context Erasure
Goals and outcomes evaluated without acknowledging organizational changes that affected them.

### Pattern 4: Selective Evidence
Positive evidence (direct report feedback, improved metrics, documentation output) dismissed or ignored; negative interpretations emphasized.

### Pattern 5: Trust-Destroying Behaviors While Requesting Trust
Public criticism, gossip culture, denying his words - while asking Joana to "build trust."

### Pattern 6: Denying Accountability
Changing stories, denying statements even when recorded, never owning mistakes.

## Recommended Actions

### Evidence to Prioritize

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Specific incident response/resolution time data (before vs during management)
- [ ] Screenshots from Confluence showing Nick didn't open criticized documents
- [ ] Quotes from direct report feedback about communication and leadership
- [ ] Timeline of self-assessment submission vs Nick's review
- [ ] Documentation of escalations that preceded negative review (emails, meeting notes)

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Emails showing Pricing Service requests to Nick before escalation
- [ ] Documentation of Kyri situation and lack of communication
- [ ] Evidence of when hiring stopped in Foundations
- [ ] Comparison of documentation output among EMs

### Questions to Raise

1. Why was the broken links issue raised on the last day despite weekly meetings?
2. How is documentation a "performance issue" when output is among the highest?
3. Why were improved incident metrics presented as criticism?
4. What specific, actionable guidance has been provided to improve?
5. How does public criticism in meetings align with building trust?
