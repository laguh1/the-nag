## 1. Performance Evaluation Issues

### 1.1 Rigid Goal Evaluation Despite Context Changes

**Issue:** Personal goals set during a transition period (Accounting to Foundations) were evaluated rigidly at year-end despite significant organizational context changes.

**Context:**
- Goals were set when transitioning between teams with different priorities
- One goal was to create a new joiner training plan when Foundations was actively hiring (many open vacancies for managers, TPMs, PMs, engineers)
- Hiring ceased mid-year, making this goal obsolete
- No feedback was provided throughout the year to adjust or redirect the goal

**Impact:**
- Spent time on work that became low-priority due to organizational changes
- Year-end performance judged against goals that no longer aligned with business needs
- Lack of ongoing feedback prevented course correction

**My approach with direct reports (contrast):**
- Inherited engineers who had already set goals before I became their manager
- Provided feedback to help adapt goals despite lacking full context
- Made goals more feasible and clear on how to achieve them
- At mid-year review, openly told engineers to adjust scope to adapt to urgent feature development needs
- Collaboratively adapted goals in writing to be achievable and meaningful to company needs
- Recognized that rigid adherence to 9-month-old goals is irresponsible in an environment with constantly changing priorities

### 1.2 Self-Assessment Context

**Situation:**
- Self-assessment written while simultaneously completing performance assessments for 18 engineers
- Prioritized writing quality feedback for engineers over personal self-assessment
- Viewed self-assessment as formality since continuous 1-on-1 conversations provided better insight into performance

**My philosophy:**
- Continuous feedback through regular conversations is more valuable than annual written assessments
- Applied this same philosophy to my own engineers - told them not to overdo self-assessments because I already knew their work through ongoing dialogue

---

## 2. Communication Criticism Contradictions

### 2.1 Vague Criticism Without Specific Examples

**Issue:** Director stated communication is becoming a "performance issue" but failed to provide specific examples of where and how communication failed.

**Evidence of contradiction:**
- Feedback from direct reports states I communicate "directly, clearly, and objectively" (from AI summary of mid-year direct report feedback)
- Director acknowledged this feedback contradicted his view but suggested I should "take his view instead"
- Public criticism in meeting with other EMs present, without concrete examples to support claims

### 2.2 Self-Assessment Links Criticism

**Specific example cited:** Broken links in self-assessment used as evidence of poor communication.

**Context missing from evaluation:**
- Self-assessment submitted more than one month before director's assessment deadline
- Weekly meetings occurred during this period - multiple opportunities to mention broken links or ask questions
- Director waited until the last day before official report publication to raise this issue
- No indication he attempted to open links to investigate why they were broken or ask for clarification

### 2.3 Audience-Aware Writing Approach

**My documented approach:**
- Write with audience in mind (engineers and managers overloaded with work)
- Use objective, straightforward language with bullet points
- Minimum detailed sections separate from main content
- Include images, videos, and bold visual messages for quick scanning
- Enable people to jump to main takeaways without reading everything

**This approach was criticized in a meeting with other EMs present** - yet it reflects the same advice director later gave: "think of who your audience is"

---

## 3. Documentation Concerns

### 3.1 Top Document Generator Despite Criticism

**The paradox:**
- Director consistently claims I have a "problem with documentation" and labels it a performance issue
- Among engineering managers (excluding senior/principal engineers), I am among the top document generators by number
- Examples used to illustrate "poor documentation" don't clearly show where I'm failing
- No concrete guidance provided on how to improve
- This standard apparently not applied equally to other professionals

### 3.2 Documents Criticized Without Being Read

**Critical issue:** Documents criticized or questioned were never actually opened or read by the director.

**Evidence:** Confluence viewer history shows documents were not accessed by him.

**Implication:** Forming negative judgments about work quality without reviewing the actual work.

### 3.3 Writing Background and Prioritization

**Context:**
- Have been writing since teenage years (aspired to be a writer, wrote short stories and novel drafts)
- PhD training - main output was writing articles, which I did successfully
- Find writing meditative when time allows proper focus

**As engineering manager:**
- Overseeing 5 different teams, 4-5 different features simultaneously
- Filling gaps left by product managers and TPMs
- Did not have separated, dedicated focus time of many hours for writing lengthy documents
- Prioritized being aware, following channels, and addressing engineers' immediate needs
- Avoided work with little impact that required long dedicated time (lengthy documents, meetings without clear actions/takeaways)
- Given economic/budget situation, focused on work that would bring tangible gains

### 3.4 Resistance to Documentation Initiatives

**Issue:** Director resisted and questioned my initiative to document git repository management decisions, configurations, and standards.

**Purpose of initiative:** Prevent company from returning to previous unmanaged state, improve team knowledge and consistency.

**Response:** Pushback rather than support.

---

## 4. Incident Management Assessment

### 4.1 The Data Contradiction

**Director's criticism:** My approach of not controlling/overseeing all incidents decreased incident management quality.

**What the actual data showed (on screen during review):**
- ✅ SLA to respond: IMPROVED (decreased/faster)
- ✅ SLA to resolve: IMPROVED (decreased/faster)
- ⚠️ Number of incidents: INCREASED (expected - more users, more features after 12 months)

**The shocking moment:** Director criticized my performance while simultaneously showing data on screen that proved performance IMPROVED in the metrics that matter (response time, resolution time).

**Interpretation:** Appears the goal was to find something to criticize regardless of actual performance data.

### 4.2 Strategic Approach - Eliminating Single Point of Failure

**Finance team experience:**
- I managed most incidents (along with Modesto for a period)
- Engineers became laid back with incident response
- Response and communication with end users was too dependent on one person
- When I was busy (performance reviews, training new joiners), on holidays, or sick, incident response quality decreased

**Foundations strategic decision:**
- Knew it would take time to learn domain/context before being able to effectively manage all incidents
- Instead of monopolizing incident management, focused on training engineers
- Goal: Eliminate myself as bottleneck and single point of failure
- Purpose of rota: Distribute responsibility, increase attention for end customers, improve recovery

**Implementation:**
- Proactively documented incident management protocols
- Trained engineers on how to respond, engage with end users, triage, assign tickets
- Educated on changing status, contacting responsible teams
- This training took time but resulted in improved response/resolution metrics
- Did NOT abandon incidents - continued overseeing, engaging, and responding while learning domain
- Many incidents show me as the person changing status, responding, engaging with end users

**Result:** Improved service metrics while building sustainable, distributed capability.

---

## 5. Goal Setting and Support

### 5.1 Lack of Ongoing Feedback

**Issue:** No feedback from director throughout the year regarding goal progress or need to adapt.

**Result:**
- Used common sense to deprioritize new joiner content when hiring stopped
- Made pragmatic decision to focus resources on urgent matters
- This practical adaptation was later used against me in year-end review

### 5.2 Unrealistic Expectation in Dynamic Environment

**Company reality:** Constant changes in priorities, new features pressured by business, evolving technical needs.

**My position:** "Setting goals 9 months ahead and making them top priority and dropping out any other work to achieve those goals is absolutely irresponsible for a professional in this company."

**What's required:** Adaptability to new technologies, changing needs, different contexts, and shifting priorities.

### 5.3 AI Writing Tool Support

**Director's suggestion:** Use AI tools to improve writing.

**Gap in support:**
- Never mentioned Copilot for Microsoft 365 was available
- When finally mentioned, I did not have access
- Asked director to show me how he used it so I could get access
- He couldn't see it on his screen, concluded I didn't have permissions
- Did not tell me how to get permissions or offer to help obtain them
- Suggested a solution but provided no actual support to implement it

---

## 6. Recognition and Acknowledgment

### 6.1 Contributions Shared With Larger Audience

**Work done to improve organization-wide practices (no recognition received):**

1. **Datadog configuration instructions** - How to solve configuration for repositories
2. **Repository guidance** - Maintenance and management to prevent returning to unmanaged state
3. **Capacity plan template** - Reusable template for easy, fast capacity planning by anyone
4. **Tool documentation** - Well-written objective documents with video tutorials
5. **EM guide collection** - Documents to guide and orient new engineering managers and people managers
6. **Process improvement communications** - Active participation in improving work and product

**Impact:** These contributions benefited teams beyond my direct reports, yet received no acknowledgment.

### 6.2 Pattern of Dismissing Positive Evidence

**Examples:**
- Positive feedback from 18 direct reports about communication dismissed as "different from his view"
- Improved incident response metrics shown on screen yet criticized as poor performance
- High documentation output among EMs yet labeled as having documentation problems
- Successful elimination of single point of failure framed as abandoning responsibilities

---

## 7. Public vs Private Feedback

### 7.1 Public Criticism Creating Hostile Environment

**Specific incident:** Publicly shamed for documentation capacity in meeting with other engineering managers present (first semester of 2025).

**Impact:**
- Demotivation
- Feeling offended
- Loss of credibility in front of peers
- Created fear of sharing work to avoid future attacks

**Behavioral response:** Stopped sharing work and initiatives to avoid criticism and public attacks.

### 7.2 Gossip Culture and Gestapo Environment

**Pattern:** Director allows/encourages engineering managers to gossip and complain about each other behind their backs rather than addressing issues directly.

**Examples needed:**
- Instances where other EMs' complaints about me were used in feedback
- Situations where I learned about behind-the-back discussions
- Times when secondhand information was used without verification

**Impact:**
- Erosion of trust among EMs
- Fear and paranoia about what's being said
- No psychological safety
- Surveillance mentality
- Division rather than collaboration
- No opportunity to provide context or defend against gossip
- Unprofessional environment

## 8. Leadership Philosophy Contrast

### 8.1 How Director's Approach Undermines Success

**Pattern of behaviors that create failure environment:**

1. **Withholds support** - Suggests tools but doesn't provide access or help obtain it
2. **Public criticism** - Criticizes in meetings with peers present
3. **Dismisses evidence** - Ignores positive feedback from direct reports, dismisses improved metrics
4. **No recognition** - Never acknowledges successful initiatives or contributions
5. **Unclear expectations** - Criticizes without specific examples or definition of success
6. **Creates obstacles** - Resists process improvement initiatives
7. **Undermines credibility** - Suggests feedback wasn't credible, brings up sick leave
8. **Provides feedback too late** - Waits until performance review to mention issues despite weekly meetings

**Impact on me:**
- Self-doubt despite positive results
- Fear of speaking up
- Withdrawal from sharing work
- Hypervigilance and anxiety
- Defensive behavior and over-preparation
- Loss of confidence
- Stress and mental health impact
- Isolation

### 8.2 How I Support Engineers' Success

**Deliberate practices that create success environment:**

1. **Provide resources and remove blockers** - Documentation, templates, tutorials with videos
2. **Give recognition publicly and privately** - Acknowledge contributions and celebrate successes
3. **Provide specific, actionable feedback** - Clear examples, define success, guide improvement
4. **Build credibility and trust** - Listen to concerns, validate expertise, trust judgment
5. **Create psychological safety** - Safe to ask questions, admit mistakes, raise concerns
6. **Invest time in 1-on-1s** - Regular individual attention, understand work through continuous conversation
7. **Shield from organizational chaos** - Handle urgent issues, manage upwards, let engineers focus
8. **Empower and delegate** - Train for independence (e.g., incident triage), eliminate myself as bottleneck
9. **Set clear priorities** - Help understand what matters, protect from low-impact work
10. **Provide growth opportunities** - Assign challenging work, encourage learning, support development

**Evidence:** Positive feedback from 18 direct reports confirms this approach works.

### 8.3 Accountability Contrast

**Director's pattern:**
- Denies mistakes even when evidence exists
- Changes stories or claims different actions
- Blames others or circumstances
- Never apologizes or takes ownership
- Deflects responsibility
- Pretends failures didn't happen

**Instances needed:**
- Specific examples where director denied responsibility despite evidence
- Times he changed his story about what was said or agreed
- Situations where he blamed others for his failures
- Examples where he pretended he did something he didn't do

**My pattern:**
- Openly acknowledge mistakes
- Take ownership without excuses
- Apologize when appropriate
- Act quickly to fix problems
- Learn from errors to prevent recurrence
- Communicate transparently about issues
- Thank people for pointing out problems
- Model accountability for team

---

## 9. Credibility and Trust

### 9.1 PM Relationship Issue

**Situation:** Raised concerns about relationship with PM.

**Director's responses:**
- "You are abandoning your team"
- "You already went on sick leave to recover from burnout" (used as evidence of weakness)
- "It might work with Trevor as he is calm and collected" (indirect suggestion I am not calm or collected)

**Later development:** When another EM had same issue with PM, director said "it's good we changed EM because it showed there was a problem indeed with the PM"

**Implication:** My feedback and collection of examples were not credible on their own - required someone else to validate before being taken seriously. My voice alone lacked credibility.

**Additional concern:** Bringing up sick leave for burnout in context of performance issue is inappropriate and potentially discriminatory.

### 9.2 Revenge Motivation Perception

**Observation:** End-of-year review felt motivated by desire for revenge.

**Context:** I escalated situations where director failed to give answers, action, or replies. When I involved others to unblock work, he seemed upset that I went around him.

**Pattern:** Negative performance review following escalations may indicate retaliatory motivation rather than objective assessment.

## 10. Organizational Culture Concerns

### 10.1 Impact on Well-being and Motivation

**Concerns about company culture:**
- Company doesn't appear to prioritize well-being
- This management approach will hinder professionals' capacity to contribute and cooperate
- Makes people less motivated, less productive
- Wastes time on unnecessary worries and defensive work

### 10.2 Fear-Based vs Trust-Based Management

**Fear-based approach creates:**
- Self-consciousness
- Reluctance to take initiative
- Withdrawal and isolation
- Defensive behaviors
- Decreased innovation
- Mental health impacts

**Trust-based approach creates:**
- Confidence
- Openness and honesty
- Growth mindset
- Initiative and calculated risks
- Collaboration
- Better performance

### 10.3 Professional Standards

**Expected professional behavior:**
- Address issues directly with person involved
- Verify information before acting
- Create supportive environment among peers
- Model professional behavior
- Establish clear communication norms
- Deal with conflicts openly and constructively
- Build trust
- Protect people from behind-the-back criticism

**Current gap:** Gossip culture, public criticism, lack of direct feedback, dismissal of evidence.

## Reflection Questions for Director

1. How can documentation be simultaneously criticized as poor while I'm among top document generators?

2. How can communication be labeled a performance issue when direct reports provide contrary feedback?

3. How can incident management be criticized as declining when SLA response and resolution times improved?

4. How can goals set during a transition be fairly evaluated at year-end without ongoing feedback when organizational context changed significantly?

5. Why were documents criticized without being opened or read?

6. Why was positive evidence (improved metrics, direct report feedback, documentation output) consistently dismissed?

7. How does public criticism in meetings with peers present align with professional management practices?

8. How does bringing up sick leave for burnout in a performance context align with well-being and inclusion values?

9. What specific, actionable steps can be taken to improve rather than vague criticism?

10. How can we build a culture of direct feedback, recognition, and trust rather than gossip and fear?

---

## Desired Outcomes

1. **Fair evaluation** based on actual performance data and outcomes, not selective interpretation
2. **Specific, actionable feedback** with clear examples and guidance for improvement
3. **Recognition** for contributions that benefit wider organization
4. **Psychological safety** to take initiative, share work, and raise concerns
5. **Direct communication** rather than gossip and behind-the-back criticism
6. **Ongoing feedback** throughout the year, not just at annual review
7. **Professional environment** based on trust, collaboration, and growth
8. **Consistent standards** applied fairly across all engineering managers
